# Experimental Plan: Validation of Quantum Mamba and Quantum Hydra Models

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive empirical validation plan for two novel quantum sequence models: Quantum Mamba and Quantum Hydra. The experiments are designed to rigorously assess their performance, efficiency, and unique capabilities against their classical counterparts, `TrueClassicalMamba` and `TrueClassicalHydra`.

The core objective is to test the hypothesis that quantum state spaces can model complex temporal and structural dependencies more effectively or efficiently than classical state spaces.

## 2. Models for Comparison

For a robust and insightful analysis, the following four model architectures will be benchmarked against each other.

1.  **TrueClassicalMamba:** The baseline unidirectional selective state space model.
2.  **TrueClassicalHydra:** The baseline bidirectional selective state space model.
3.  **QuantumMamba (2 Variants):** The novel unidirectional quantum models.
4.  **QuantumHydra (2 Variants):** The novel bidirectional quantum models.

### Quantum Model Variants

The quantum models will be implemented and tested in two distinct hybrid quantum-classical variants to explore different ways of leveraging quantum computation:

*   **Variant 1 (Quantum Parameterizer):** A Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is used as a highly expressive function to generate a subset of the classical SSM parameters (e.g., the state transition matrix `A` or the input matrix `B`). The state evolution itself remains classical. This variant focuses on quantum-enhanced expressivity in a practical, near-term setup.
*   **Variant 2 (Quantum State Evolution):** The SSM's state vector `x[t]` is encoded as a quantum state (a vector of amplitudes). The state transition is performed by a parameterized quantum circuit that evolves the quantum state based on the classical input `u[t]`. This is a more "fully quantum" approach designed to test the fundamental capabilities of quantum state spaces.

## 3. Proposed Experiments

The following three experiments are designed to probe the models' capabilities on diverse tasks, ranging from practical classical data processing to quantum-native simulations.

### Experiment 1: Modeling Complex Classical Time-Series

This experiment assesses the models' ability to capture complex, long-range dependencies in classical time-series data.

*   **Hypothesis:** The quantum state space in the Quantum Mamba and Hydra models will enable them to capture complex temporal correlations more efficiently (i.e., with fewer parameters) or with higher accuracy than their classical counterparts.
*   **Datasets:**
    1.  **PhysioNet EEG Data:** A real-world medical time-series dataset characterized by noisy signals and subtle, non-local patterns. The primary task will be seizure detection or sleep stage classification.
    2.  **Financial Time-Series:** Stock price or volatility prediction using historical market data. This data is known for its chaotic behavior and hidden dependencies.
    3.  **Synthetic NARMA(10) Task:** A standard benchmark for recurrent models that requires remembering information over long windows, serving as a controlled test of long-range dependency modeling.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Performance:** Accuracy and F1-Score (for classification tasks), Mean Squared Error (MSE) (for prediction tasks).
    *   **Efficiency:** Total number of trainable parameters. A key goal is to determine if the quantum models can achieve comparable performance with a smaller parameter count.

### Experiment 2: Sequential Data with Hierarchical Structure

This experiment targets data where relationships are compositional and hierarchical, testing the models' ability to understand syntax and structure.

*   **Hypothesis:** The bidirectional architecture of Quantum Hydra will provide a significant performance advantage over the unidirectional Quantum Mamba on tasks requiring both past and future context. Furthermore, its quantum components may allow it to discover more complex structural patterns than Classical Hydra.
*   **Datasets:**
    1.  **DNA/Genomic Data:** Tasks such as promoter site prediction or protein function classification from amino acid sequences. These sequences contain complex, nested motifs that are critical for their biological function.
    2.  **Symbolic Music Analysis:** Using a dataset like JSB Chorales, the task will be to classify a musical piece by its composer. This requires capturing the hierarchical structure of melody and harmony.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Performance:** Classification Accuracy.
    *   **Qualitative Analysis:** For models capable of generation, a qualitative inspection of generated sequences to assess if they have learned coherent long-term structures.

### Experiment 3: Modeling Quantum Systems (Quantum-Native Task)

This is a theoretically-driven experiment to determine if a quantum model is inherently superior at learning the dynamics of a quantum system.

*   **Hypothesis:** The Quantum Mamba and Hydra models, especially the "Quantum State Evolution" variant, will significantly outperform their classical counterparts in predicting the behavior of a simulated quantum system, as their internal state can more naturally represent the system's quantum state.
*   **Dataset:**
    1.  **Simulated Quantum Dynamics:** A synthetic dataset will be generated by simulating the time evolution of a multi-qubit spin chain under the influence of a time-varying magnetic field. The model's input `u[t]` will be the control parameters (magnetic field strength), and the target output `y[t]` will be the expectation value of an observable (e.g., the magnetization of a specific qubit).
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Performance:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the model's prediction and the true simulated expectation value.
    *   **Expressivity Analysis:** Utilize Quantum Machine Learning metrics like *effective dimension* and *entanglement capability* to analyze how effectively the models are using their quantum resources.
